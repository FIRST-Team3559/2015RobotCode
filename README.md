# 2015RobotCode

This is the code that will be used on Team 3559's 2015 robot. Consider this to be the official code.
We are constucting a command-based program for the first time this year. We will have three subsystems: drive, elevator, and forks. We know at this time the elevator will have a feedback loop in the form of limit switches [definitely] and a 10-turn potentiometer for position [hopefully].
